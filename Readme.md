## Configuration

Before using the rsstojson API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.  
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com)

---

## Usage

The RSS to JSON API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/api/rsstojson](https://docs.apiverve.com/api/rsstojson).  
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

###### Authentication
RSS to JSON API uses API Key-based authentication. When you create an instance of the API client, you can pass your API Key as a parameter.

```
// Create an instance of the API client
var apiClient = new RSStoJSONAPIClient("[YOUR_API_KEY]", true);
```

---


### Perform Request
Using the API client, you can perform requests to the API.

###### Define Query

```
var queryOptions = new RSStoJSONQueryOptions {
  url = "https://www.nasa.gov/rss/dyn/breaking_news.rss"
};
```

###### Simple Request

```
var response = apiClient.Execute(queryOptions);
if(response.error != null) {
	Console.WriteLine(response.error);
} else {
    var jsonResponse = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(response, Newtonsoft.Json.Formatting.Indented);
    Console.WriteLine(jsonResponse);
}
```

###### Example Response
